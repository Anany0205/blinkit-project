****#Blinkit Dashboard**

This project presents an interactive sales analysis dashboard built for Blinkit (India's Last Minute App). The dashboard provides deep insights into total sales, average sales, number of items, customer ratings, outlet performance, and product categories. It helps stakeholders and decision-makers track performance trends, identify high-performing categories, and optimize outlet strategies.

The dashboard is created using Power BI (can also be replicated in Tableau/Excel) and allows users to apply filters such as Outlet Location, Outlet Size, and Item Type for customized analysis.

To track total sales, item distribution, and customer ratings.
